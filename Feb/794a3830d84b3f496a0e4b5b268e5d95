The English Access Microscholarship Program in Bahir Dar was launched at Bahir Dar University today (February 26, 2018). “Through the Access program, Ethiopian youths will acquire English language and life skills that will create new opportunities and pave the way to a successful future,” said Counselor for Public Affairs David Kennedy.  He added, “These students are part of Access programs already underway in Debre Birhan, Haramaya and Hawassa. Currently more than 300 youths are participating in Access, and we are extremely proud of their progress.”  Sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, the two-year English Access Microscholarship Program is an after-school English language program for talented 13-to-20 year-olds from disadvantaged communities. The program helps students develop proficiency in the English language from beginners to intermediate level, and provides them with a variety of experiences to enhance their confidence, learn about the United States, and instill volunteerism, positive civic values and attitudes. Access seeks to equip students with strong English language skills that can lead to better jobs, educational opportunities, and gain ability to participate in and compete for exchange and study programs in the United States. 100 students are selected for the program in Bahir Dar, which will take place on weekends and during the summer break. Since its inception in 2004, approximately 95,000 students in more than 85 countries have participated in the English Access Microscholarship Program.
