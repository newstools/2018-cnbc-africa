WHEN: Thursday, 9 August, 2018; 08:00am to 13:00pm. WHERE: Imperial Royale Hotel, Kampala WHO: Hon. Janat Mukwaya, Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development Ms. Noreen Prendiville, Deputy Representative UNICEF Uganda WHY:  Children have the right to be protected from all forms of violence – physical, sexual and emotional abuse as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child among other international and regional instruments, which have been ratified by Uganda. Unfortunately for children in Uganda, violence, exploitation and abuse are still common, as will be highlighted by the significant evidence from the Survey that we are launching on Thursday 9 August, 2018. Unlike previous research done, the first ever national survey provides nationally representative data on the prevalence, nature and consequences of physical, emotional and sexual violence against children in Uganda as well as sub-national estimates of the vice.
