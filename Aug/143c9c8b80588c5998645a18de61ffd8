Download logo A special investigation team has been appointed to probe a telephone interview between Talk Radio 702 and inmate Rodovan Krejcir which was aired on 10 August 2018. This is a serious transgression considering that inmates do not have the right to be interviewed, unless permission is granted by the relevant authority.  The investigation team has been given 24 hours to conduct an inquiry and report back to the National Commissioner of Correctional Services.Â  The Department has further deployed an experienced senior manager to oversee operations at Leeuwkop Correctional Facility until further notice.  Correctional Services takes this matter seriously as it undermines the mandate of corrections which entails safe and secure custody of inmates under humane conditions. Hence, unbecoming behaviour by officials and inmates will not be tolerated.  Caution must always be exercised by our partners, the media, when engaging with inmates through illegal means as this comes with unprecedented risk to the community, our officials and even greater risk for the victims of crime.  Correctional Services is utterly dismayed by this conduct and those who aided inmate Rodovan Krejcir will be spared no mercy.
