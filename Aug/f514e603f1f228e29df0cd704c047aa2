ThreadSol (www.ThreadSol.com)- the pioneer in enterprise material management for sewn products’ industry, is pleased to participate in Origin Africa 2018 from 9th September to 11th September at booth #46. During the fair, ThreadSol will present its range of innovative software solutions for the apparel manufacturers.  In these times of ascending costs and descending profit margins, ThreadSol has a crucial role to play in the apparel industry, especially in Africa with the emergence of the industry. The company’s presence at Origin Africa establishes its commitment to sustaining its efforts of introducing innovative garment tech solutions for the apparel industry. “Our presence at Origin Africa is a proof of our commitment to the apparel industry, especially the African apparel industry. The solutions we are offering at the expo demonstrates that we are continuously aiming to accomplish our customer’s requirements to aid them in overcoming the challenges of the industry and increase profitability by targeting the biggest expense in manufacturing- fabric”, says Anas Shakil, Senior Partner at ThreadSol. ThreadSol’s outlook is to introduce technologically driven products to drive African apparel manufacturing by boosting topline and bottom line for manufacturers and differentiate from the extremely competitive environment for breakthrough profits and improved customer service. With challenges like high electricity prices, limited access to finance, infrastructural obstacles, challenging logistics, and for non-EPZ companies, complex regulations, it is extremely crucial for apparel manufacturers in Kenya to realize the importance of cost saving and increasing their output. In addition, labor skill is another challenge. It is important to understand and implement automation which can provide more efficiency and high yield in the long run.  ThreadSol solutions- intelloBuy and intelloCut together work with the notion to boost revenue and profits for apparel manufacturers. The solutions work for the buying floor and cutting floor respectively and ensure reduction in fabric expenses at the buying stage and cutting of extra garment pieces at the cutting stage. The overall benefit is automation of the buying and cutting process which ultimately saves hours of manpower in the facilities. These solutions have been adopted by the top manufacturers worldwide like MAS (Sri Lanka), Epic Group (Bangladesh), Raymond (India), PAN Brothers (Indonesia), HS Fashions (China), Sangwoo (Vietnam) etc. “We at ThreadSol bring up to 80% reduction in planning time to ensure that the manufacturing cost go down and hence the profits go up by 30-40%”, adds Anas Shakil. ThreadSol’s participation in Origin Africa is a step further to market its solutions to the potential manufacturers who can now invest in ThreadSol’s innovative solutions to reinvent their manufacturing efficiency and boost profit margins.
