Download logo Statement by Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo: Anniversary of the Bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: Today, on the twentieth anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we remember the victims of these terrorist attacks. These bombings, carried out by al-Qa’ida, resulted in more than 250 deaths and nearly 5,000 injuries. We will never forget the legacy of those who perished, nor the courage, bravery, and valor of all who survived.  Today also reminds us that we must continue to be vigilant to prevent further attacks.  We must honor the memory of those we mourn today by pressing the cause of freedom and justice.  Our partnership with our African allies remains stronger than ever.  As we remember and honor the sacrifices of the victims and their families, we stand together in the continuing fight against terrorism.
