Download logo The 21st of October 2018 marks the centenary of Nontsikelelo Albertina Sisulu. To celebrate the year, the Tambo Foundation has collaborated with the University of Johannesburg and the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung to host an event celebrating Ma Sisulu, but most importantly, the legacy she left behind for all South Africans to fulfil.  The event will serve as a platform to discuss how to harness the immense power of women, under the theme when women organise. By analysing the organisational feat that was the 9 August 1956 Women’s March to the Union Buildings, of which Ma Sisulu was an organiser, the discussion seeks to harness and replicate that strength and energy in tackling the issues facing women today and finding solutions for broader development. This event will be about the boundless opportunities and solutions that exist when women organise. The event will feature musical performances by UJ’s Female Vocal Ensemble. And, given Ma Sisulu’s fierce belief in the power of education, the event will also have an “entrance fee” of a packet of sanitary towels for the Tambo Foundation’s Nkantolo Education Programme – striving to keep girl learners in school. Panel members: – Thenjiwe Mtintso – Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi – Thandeka Gqubule – Nomtuse Mbere – Thuto Thipe Members of the media are invited to attend and cover the event as follows: Date: Thursday, 16 August 2018 Time: 17:30 for 18:00 Venue: University of Johannesburg, FADA Auditorium, Bunting Road Campus, Auckland Park Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Republic of South Africa: Department of Government Communication and Information.
