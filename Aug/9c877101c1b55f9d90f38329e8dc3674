Download logo The Recorded live births, 2017 report released by Statistics South Africa today shows that a total of 989 318 births were registered in South Africa in 2017. This indicates an increase of 2,1% from the 969 415 birth registrations in  2016. Of the 989 318 births registered in 2017, 897 750 were current registrations (births that occurred in 2017) whereas 91 568 were late registrations (births that occurred in 2016 and earlier). A majority of the current births registrations were for male children (460 774) while 452 725 were for females, resulting in a sex ratio of 102. No comparable or reliable information on fathers could be provided due to a high proportion of births registered (61,7%) without details of fathers.  The most populous provinces Gauteng (239 457) and KwaZulu-Natal (197 913) had the highest number of total birth registrations. The lowest number of birth registrations were observed in Northern Cape (24 395) and Free State (50 130) which is also in line with the population sizes of the provinces.  The number and percentage distribution of registered births by age of the mother and status of registration for births that occurred in 2017 shows that of the 897 750 births that occurred and were registered in 2017, age group 30−34 years (95,5%) accounted for the highest proportion of current birth registrations, followed by 25−29 years (95,1%) and 35−39 years (94,7%). Current birth registrations for births that occurred in 2017 were lowest for age groups 10-14 years (39,9%) as well as age group 50-54 years (45,6%)  The births and Deaths registration Amendment Act (Act No. 18 of 2010) regulates that registration of birth must be within 30 days after birth has occurred. Of the 897 750 births which occurred in 2017, 78% were compliant   with regulation. North West was the leading province in terms of births registered within 30 days at 92% and the lowest was KwaZulu-Natal at 66%.
