Download logo On behalf of the Agri Sector Unity Forum (ASUF) we extend an invitation to all media institutions to attend the ASUF media conference.  The purpose of the media conference is the following:  The four presidents of organised agriculture have committed themselves to work together to achieve the following: 	To in collaboration with government develop a joint agricultural development plan for agriculture and ensure a growing and inclusive agricultural sector aligned with the outcomes of the National Development Plan. 	These outcomes entail amongst other things food security, job creation, development, sustainability and higher levels of competitiveness. 	To build mutual trust, collaboration and bring about stability in the sector 	To identify all the constraints, especially government policies, plans and institutional incapacity that are impeding on development and growth in the sector and initiate alternative interventions. Given our experience in the field of agriculture, ASUF wishes to provide greater input in terms of how best to achieve these outcomes.  On behalf of ASUF (AFASA, TAU-SA, NAFU SA and Agri SA).
