Download logo The South African Revenue Service (SARS)Â  met with the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa (TISA) and the Fair-trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) on 15 August 2018 at the SARS Head Office in order to discuss and agree on collaboration among them to combat illicit trade in cigarette and all tobacco products.  FITA and TISA, which represent approximately 99% of the tobacco industry, have committed to taking action against any of their members that are found to be contravening the Tax, Customs and Excise laws of the country, including but not limited to suspension and/or expulsion. The two associations also committed to ensuring that their members fully comply with the relevant legislation at all times. Members who may be in contravention of the laws are encouraged to take corrective action through available avenues, including making full disclosure to SARS. All parties acknowledge their shared responsibility in combatting illicit trade in cigarette and tobacco products in the best interest of economic growth and compliance with Tax, Customs and Excise laws. The Acting Commissioner of SARS expressed his appreciation to both parties for their commitment towards improving compliance in the industry.
