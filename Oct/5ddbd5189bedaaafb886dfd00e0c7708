About 820 million people still suffer from hunger.  Most of them are women.  Some 155 million children are chronically malnourished and may endure the effects of stunting for their entire lives.  And hunger causes almost half of the infant deaths worldwide.  This is intolerable.  On World Food Day, let us commit to a world without hunger — a world in which every person has access to a healthy, nutritious diet.  Zero hunger is about joining forces.  Countries and companies, institutions and individuals: we must each do our part towards sustainable food systems.  Today, we renew our commitment to uphold everyone’s fundamental right to food and to leave no one behind. Thank you. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN Information Centre in Cairo.
