 Less than 24 hours to go before the opening of one of Africa’s trials of the century. Thousands are expected to descend on Durban High Court in Kwa Zulu Natal for the opening of the trial of former South African president Jacob Zuma – the rare sight of an African leader facing the courts in his own country. Zuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering.
