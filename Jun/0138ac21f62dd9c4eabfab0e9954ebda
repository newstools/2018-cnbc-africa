 FSD Africa today launched the findings of a study on M-Akiba, the worldâ€™s first Treasury bond delivered by mobile phone. The bond issued by the Kenyan government back in 2017, targeted $10 million but only raised about a quarter of that figure. Joining CNBC Africa to discuss this and provide practical recommendations for future mobile-delivered bond services in Africa is Evans Osano, Director, Financial Markets, FSD Africa.
