The Department of Environmental Affairs sends warm congratulatory messages of appreciation and pride to all the seven staff members, green runners, who participated in the 93rd edition of the Comrades Marathon.  The Minister, Dr Edna Molewa and Deputy Minister Barbara Thomson joined the Director-General Nosipho Ngcaba in congratulating Team DEA Athletics for being an inspiration to all of us and for displaying such resilience during the marathon.  The athletes, who are members of the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) Athletics Club, are Lehlogonolo Kgaabi; Thifhelimbilu Mudau; Zintle Mapekula; Vincent Gololo; Thulasizwe Ndlovu; Makgale Moela and Obed Baloyi.  The Comrades Marathon is a gruesome race and there are always complications. “A special message of appreciation to Vincent Gololo, who was the first runner home. To all who missed the final cut off, it does not matter how many times we fall but how many times we stand up after falling,” says DEA.  The Department has expressed pride in the team and applauded their performance. “We would like to congratulate the green runners for their endurance and camaraderie during this marathon,” says DEA.  The Department would also like to commend Bongumsa Mthembu for defending his Comrades Marathon title and Ann Ashworth for winning the women’s race. “We are truly delighted and certainly proud of their outstanding performance that raises the South African flag high,” adds DEA.
