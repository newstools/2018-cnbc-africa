A 21-20 win over Scotland saw Kenya claim a thirteenth place finish at the season ending Paris Sevens. The three points from this result saw the side accumulate 104 points (their highest ever tally) and an eighth place finish at the conclusion of the 2017/18 HSBC Sevens World Series on Sunday 10 June 2018.  Shujaa (www.KRU.co.ke) were left rueing their 5-24 Pool A opening defeat to New Zealand which put paid to their cup quarterfinal ambitions despite a 22-19 win over eventual pool winners Fiji and a 24-10 result over Samoa that saw them finish third in a three way tie with Fiji and New Zealand on 7 points. A 12-19 Challenge Trophy quarterfinal loss to Argentina consigned the team to the thirteenth place playoff semi where they overcame Russia 26-14 before defeating Scotland in a topsy turvy final that saw the Scots race to a 10-0 lead through tries from James Farndale and Joe Nayacavou before Eden Agero converted tries from Willy Ambaka and Collins Injera to see Shujaa lead 14-10 at the interval. The Scots were back in the lead when Robert Ferguson’s unconverted effort saw them go 15-14 up but Herman Humwa’s football skills were vital in seeing him control and gather the ball for a touch down, Agero converting for a 21-15 lead, Farndale landing his brace for Scotland as the Kenyans held out for the result.
