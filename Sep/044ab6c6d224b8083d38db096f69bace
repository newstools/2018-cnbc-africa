A key aspect of the anniversary was to invite those who were close to the Constitution drafting process to write about that ground-breaking moment in our history.  The books, which Parliament is launching next week, are a product of that initiative. They contain contributions and perspectives from a wide range of current and past Members of Parliament and other South Africans who reflect, among others, on the:  – Character of The Democratic State, – Structure of Government, – Relationship between Spheres of Government – Judicial System in our New Democratic Dispensation, and – Specialised Structures of Government.  Leaders of political parties; members of the Executive; the Tambo, Mandela and Sisulu families; and leaders of civil society formations such as the academia are also expected to grace the launch ceremony.
