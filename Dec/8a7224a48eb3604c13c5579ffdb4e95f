Gen Sinkamba named some of the clubs such as Green Eagles, Mufulira, Red Arrows, Ndola & Diggers as some of the teams to have celebrated the achievement of their charges. He singled out Eagles, Mufulira and Arrows for spearheading the inclusion of girls/ women's rugby in their programs.     “It is gratifying to note that it's not only the senior teams/clubs that are honoring their players but also some youth teams too, cases in point are Lusaka Youth Rugby and Waya Community Youth Rugby in Kabwe. We believe such kind of motivation will be useful when the next rugby commences, as players will have to work hard on and off the pitch so as to be the next recipients in the coming season”, he said.     The ZRU Boss has further wished other clubs to follow suit and host similar or related functions as a way of giving players something to look forward to. “As we enter the New Year I appeal to everyone involved in the process of getting teams prepared for the upcoming season to start as soon as possible so as to avoid limiting the growth of the game in their locations. Go out to Schools and Communities to announce your activities as a way of setting up partnerships for future linkages” he conclu Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Zambia Rugby Union (ZRU).Media contact:  Rugby@APO-opa.org
