Download logoWorld leaders are beginning to recognize the enormous pressures facing our oceans and waters, from plastic pollution to the adverse impacts of climate change. At the same time, governments are committed to develop marine-related economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner for the benefit of all. It is in this context that the Kenyan government is hosting the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference. This high-level, global conference will bring together about 4,000 participants to identify the economic benefits of healthy waters and capture donors’ commitment to help the world transition to a blue economy.      Media are invited as part of the World Bank’s long-term engagement with media to promote transparency, good governance, and sustainability as coastal countries embrace the blue economy. The World Bank will contribute to various sessions to:    • present its blue economy portfolio of $4.1 billion including projects ranging from implementing large regional fisheries programs in Africa and the Pacific, to tackling all sources of marine pollution, protecting critical marine habitats and supporting coastal development worldwide.     • showcase its role in building the resilience of coastal communities; and  • announce its commitment to raise USD$3 billion through the Ocean and Freshwater Bonds to support coastal livelihoods.
