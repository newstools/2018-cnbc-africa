(“NESR”) (NASDAQ: NESR; NASDAQ: NESRW), a national, industry-leading provider of integrated energy services in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and Asia Pacific region, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.   Operating and Financial Highlights  Revenue on a combined basis grew by over 10% from the prior quarter and by more than 20% compared to the prior year quarter with new contract start-ups and product offerings as well as increases in market share in NESR's key markets. 	Net income of $16.2 million for the successor quarter period compared to a net loss for the preceding period of $4 million. 	Adjusted EBITDA on a combined basis for the third quarter was $46.5 million, a sequential growth in excess of 30% on the back of increased service intensity and startup of new contracts as well as realization of integration synergies. 	Signed an agreement with Dhahran Techno Valley Company (“DTVC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of King Fahd University of Petroleum, to create a global center for the development of scientific research in DTVC. This is in line with NESR's vision to create an open source platform in the region to partner with innovative technology companies to create fit for purpose technologies for our customers in the region. 	Acquired quality coiled tubing and pumping assets of North American service company to deploy in the MENA region. “We are very pleased with our results for the third quarter,” said Sherif Foda, Chairman of the Board and CEO of NESR. “NESR is attractively positioned, with the ability to capitalize on its footprint across the MENA region. We remain encouraged by the outlook for our key markets, and we believe the services industry in the region will continue to grow further over the coming quarters. Additionally, as MENA activity increases in the fourth quarter, we have been deploying our resources strategically to take advantage of this trend.” Mr. Foda continued, “I am very proud of the employees of both companies we acquired as our integration efforts continue to exceed expectations and are showing significant results. At NESR, we value agility, empowerment and fast decision making and this quarter's operational and financial results are a testimony to the hard work of our personnel as well as the faith our customers have placed in our ability to deliver superior execution. Our ability to respond quickly and efficiently to our customers' needs has already distinguished us and will continue to be a competitive advantage. We are very excited about the future and we have talented, motivated teams to execute at the highest levels of quality.” Production Services Segment Results Production Services contributed $88.7 million to consolidated revenue for the 2018 Successor third quarter period. Segment EBITDA totaled $33.2 million in the quarter. In addition to higher activity across all our product lines, this segment benefitted from the redeployment of idle assets where operations overlapped as well as from contract start-up costs recorded in the second quarter which did not recur in the third quarter. See “Business Combination Accounting and Presentation of Results of Operations” section below for additional information on current reporting conventions.

Segment EBITDA totaled $17.6 million in the quarter. The improved performance of this segment was most noticeably impacted by new drilling contract start-ups with improved pricing along with the continued growth and expansion of our evaluation service offerings.

Net Income and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Results The Company had Successor period net income for the third quarter totaling $16.2 million, which includes the impact of $2.4 million of transaction and integration costs related to the combination transaction completed in June 2018 and $3.6 million of purchase accounting related amortization costs incurred in the quarter. On a combined basis, the Company had Adjusted EBITDA of $111.8 million for the year to date period through September 30, 2018. Adjustments to EBITDA include transaction and integration costs of $25 million for the 2018 period. Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents were $67.6 million as of September 30, 2018 (Successor), compared to $27.5 million as of December 31, 2017 (Predecessor) and $36.9 million as of June 30, 2018. The Company had $355.3 million in debt as of September 30, 2018 including a $50 million convertible loan facility with an implied conversion price of 11.244 per share. During July, the Company completed a refinancing of its $50 million bridge loan facility to term out the debt. Additionally, in July the Company entered into a previously disclosed $50 million working capital facility and drew down $25 million under the facility. During August, the Company drew down the remaining $25 million to provide the company with financial flexibility and seize growth opportunities as and when they arise. The Company purchased certain assets from a North American service company for $7 million in cash. Offsetting these asset additions were additional adjustments to the fixed asset values made as part of the Company's finalization of purchase price accounting. Improvements to working capital efficiency were initiated post-combination and the Company anticipates additional benefits from these actions to be reflected in the year-end balance sheet. Predecessor/Successor Accounting Treatment NESR continues to report in a Predecessor/Successor format whereby the National Petroleum Services (“NPS”) legacy entity is the Predecessor for periods prior to the completion of the business combination on June 7, 2018 and NESR, including NPS and Gulf Energy Services (“GES”), is the Successor for post-transaction periods.

Business Combination Accounting and Presentation of Results of Operations As a result of the Business Combination, NESR was determined to be the accounting acquirer and NPS was determined to be the predecessor for SEC reporting purposes. Pursuant to Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), a preliminary assessment was made as of the acquisition-date fair value of the purchase consideration paid by NESR to effect the Business Combination was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulting from the Business Combination, the financial statements and certain footnote presentations separate our presentations into two distinct sets of reporting periods, the periods before the consummation of the transaction (“Predecessor Periods”) and the period after that date (“Successor Period”), to indicate the application of the different basis of accounting between the periods presented. The Predecessor Periods reflect the historical financial information of NPS prior to the Business Combination, while the Successor Period reflects our consolidated financial information, including the results of NPS and GES, after the Business Combination. The Successor Periods are from June 7, 2018 to September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Predecessor Periods are from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and from January 1, 2018 to June 6, 2018.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME  (Unaudited)  (In thousands) The Company uses and presents certain key non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business and trends, measure performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Included in this earnings release are discussions of earnings before interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-core expenses (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as well a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing its financial performance and results of operations as the Company's board of directors, management and investors use Adjusted EBITDA to compare the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of changes in capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization and impairment), items that do not impact the ongoing operations (Business Combination transaction expenses and related integration costs) and items outside the control of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Company's results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
