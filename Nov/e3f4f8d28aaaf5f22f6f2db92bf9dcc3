Global market research company Euromonitor International launched a global study on illicit alcohol. The multi-region report compiles findings from 24 countries in Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Results show that 26 percent of the total volume of alcohol consumed in these countries is illicit. Out of the 25 countries covered by Euromonitor’s research, Africa has the largest illicit alcohol problem. Whilst almost double the number of countries were covered in South America, Africans consume double the volumes (in absolute alcohol terms) of illicit alcohol. Key points on illicit alcohol in Sub-Saharan Africa • South Africa witnessed the largest fiscal loss out of the 7 African countries due to illicit trade despite the low share of illicit to licit litres of absolute alcohol (LAE) volume predominantly due to its tax strategies. • In international standards and even by African standards, South Africans consume excessive amounts of alcohol. The country has the second highest per capita alcohol consumption, falling just behind Zambia. • South Africa has the largest variance between the price that consumers can purchase legal alcohol vs what they pay for illicit alcohol (51%) and it is well above the regional average of 42%. • In 5 of the 8 countries covered the share of the illicit alcohol market is more than 50%, which means that 1 in every two 2 alcoholic beverages consumed, are illicit. In Zambia, this number is much higher. At 69.5% percent, Zambia is second only to Mozambique and almost 3 out of every 4 alcohol drinks are illicit. • Measured on a per capita basis, Zambians drink the largest amount of legal alcohol but also drink the most illegal alcohol. These numbers are measured on an LAE basis so this is absolute alcohol consumption. South Africans follow closely when it comes to the per capita consumption of illicit alcohol. • Whilst smuggling is present across all the countries researched, Zambia loses by far the most of its tax revenue to smuggling (71%). <img class="alignnone wp-image-322884" src="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="547" srcset="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1.jpg 789w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1-768x581.jpg 768w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1-80x60.jpg 80w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1-696x527.jpg 696w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20135917/Alcohol-1-555x420.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" />  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322885" src="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2.jpg" alt="" width="790" height="603" srcset="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2.jpg 790w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2-300x229.jpg 300w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2-768x586.jpg 768w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2-696x531.jpg 696w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140001/Alcohol-2-550x420.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" />  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322886" src="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3.jpg" alt="" width="789" height="601" srcset="https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3.jpg 789w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3-300x229.jpg 300w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3-768x585.jpg 768w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3-80x60.jpg 80w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3-696x530.jpg 696w, https://cdn.cnbcafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20140103/Alcohol-3-551x420.jpg 551w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /> Article provided by Euromonitor International.
