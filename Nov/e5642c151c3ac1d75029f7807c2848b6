The attack was attributed to the UPC (Union for Peace in the Central African Republic).  In a separate attack on a base of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) on 16 November in Gbambia in the south-west of the country a Tanzanian peace keeper was killed. The attack is suspected to have been conducted by the Siriri armed group.    United Nations peacekeepers were protecting civilians seeking refuge in its camp as the village of Gbambia was attacked. The peacekeeper from Tanzania was wounded in the attack and later succumbed to his injuries.      The Secretary-General offers his deepest condolences to the families of all the victims, as well as to the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania. He stands in solidarity with the Government and people of the Central African Republic.  The Secretary-General recalls that attacks against United Nations peacekeepers as well as those against defenseless civilians may constitute war crimes and calls on the Central African Republic authorities to investigate them and swiftly bring those responsible to justice.     The Secretary-General reiterates the determination of MINUSCA to protect civilians and to contribute to the stabilization of the Central African Republic.
