Download logo President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Thursday, 22 November 2018, address a formal sitting of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) at Alberton Civic Centre in Gauteng.  The President’s annual NCOP address, followed by a debate and his reply, will conclude the week long NCOP Taking Parliament to the People programme which is currently underway. The TPTTP programme which started on Monday 19 November 2018, is covering all municipalities of the Gauteng province.  The programme, held under the theme “Impact of migration – Deepening cooperative governance for accelerated service delivery and development,” is a parliamentary oversight programme which also serves as platform for the public to hold their leaders accountable on service delivery issues raised through public hearings. Initiated in 2002, the programme enables the NCOP to exercise its constitutional obligation of overseeing the execution of government programmes and policies, and facilitating meaningful public participation.  One of the strengths of this flagship programme of Parliament is that it gives ordinary citizens an opportunity to engage their elected public representatives face-to-face on a regular basis on issues affecting them.  In the spirit of cooperative governance, the programme brings together all three spheres of government under one roof, to account to the electorate for their service delivery promises.  Details of the address are as follows: Date: 22 November 2018 Time: 09.30 Venue: Alberton Civic Centre, City of Ekurhuleni, Gauteng Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Republic of South Africa: The Parliament.
