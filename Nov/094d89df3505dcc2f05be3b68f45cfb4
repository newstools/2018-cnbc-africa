It is a day to advocate and garner support and raise awareness on the most pressing issues facing children – a day to 'play one’s part' in building a world where every child is in school, safe from harm, and can fulfill their potential.  To mark this day in West and Central Africa, 10 children and adolescents from six countries in the region came together in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to deliver on the World Children’s Day Platform, very captivating and powerful speeches about the Africa They Want during an ‘Africa Dialogues’ event supported by UNICEF (www.UNICEF.org). ‘’I want an Africa where the right of the child would be respected by all and were the Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved by 2030,’’ said Precious Anastasia, 14-year-old, from Cameroon, one of the 10 young speakers, who spoke about quality and inclusive education in Africa. The event is a collaboration between the People Initiative Foundation (www.PeopleInitiativeFoundation.org) and UNICEF, in partnership with the African Union.
