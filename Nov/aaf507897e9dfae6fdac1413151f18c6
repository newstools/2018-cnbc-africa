Being in charge of managing a SAR area implies that vessels carrying migrants and refugees can be ordered to disembark in Libya.  Representatives of UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will also update the committee on the situation of migrants and asylum seekers stranded in Libya, particularly in detention centres, and on the progress of the programme for Voluntary Humanitarian Return to countries of origin, managed by IOM.

When: Tuesday, 27 November, from 11.45 to 13.00 Where: European Parliament in Brussels, József Antall (4Q2) Distributed by APO Group on behalf of European Parliament.
