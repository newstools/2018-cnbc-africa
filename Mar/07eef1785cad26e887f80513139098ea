Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta called opposition leader Raila Odinga “his brother” on Friday and promised they would both start the process of bringing the people together after last year’s contentious elections.  In a live television address jointly with Kenyatta on the steps of the president’s office, Odinga said time had come to resolve “our” differences. It was the first public appearance by the two politicians together since a repeat presidential election last Oct. 26.
