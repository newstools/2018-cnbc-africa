Angola’s economic growth is expected to quicken to 2.25 percent this year from one percent in 2017, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday.  Angola’s economy is expected to expand by 2.25 percent this year from 1 percent in 2017 and growth should reach 5 percent in the medium-term, Ricardo Velloso, IMF division chief for Africa, told reporters in Luanda. Since coming to power in September, Lourenco has vowed to revive sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest economy, attract investment and combat the endemic corruption that plagued the 38 year rule of his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Velloso said Lourenco’s government had already supported the economy by devaluing the kwanza currency, promising to reduce debt and restructuring state oil company Sonangol. He also said higher oil prices had helped. “The Angolan economy is experiencing a mild recovery. The new administration is rightly focusing on restoring macroeconomic stability and improving governance,” the IMF told reporters in Luanda.
