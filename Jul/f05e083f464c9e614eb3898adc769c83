Ambassador Nikki Haley, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, delivered remarks this morning at a UN Security Council briefing on Women, Peace, and Security in the Sahel region.  “Here at the United Nations, we have combined this passion for amplifying women’s voices with a belief that human rights issues – including the rights of women and girls – are a critical element for peace and security. When women’s voices are silenced – either through violence, lack of political rights, or lack of education – entire communities suffer, and that suffering leads to conflict.”  “The United States is strongly committed to empowering women in developing communities from the ground up. We work to ensure that our assistance goes directly to the kinds of women I meet with on my trips abroad: the mothers struggling to feed their families, educate their kids, and create a future for their families and their communities. The women pushing through barriers to have equal political representation. The entrepreneurs, pioneers, goal setters, and other extraordinary women changing the face of society. Across Africa, the U.S. is helping to build the capacity of regional organizations and the African Union to support women’s political participation.”  “The thread that runs through all of these efforts is that when we bring together women with power and resources, we create deeper, more sustainable prosperity. And that stability and prosperity protects human rights and promotes security.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Africa Regional Media Hub.Media filesDownload logo
