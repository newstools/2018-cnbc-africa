Telecommunications and Postal Services Deputy Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams and Communications Deputy Minister Pinky Kekana, will, on 20 July 2018, lead a Mandela Day outreach programme at BK Matlala Commercial High School, Matlala-a-Thaba area, Limpopo.  The outreach is a joint programme in partnership with POPCRU Group of Companies (PGC), Safer SA, Kimmotive and Vodacom.  In 2011, BK Matlala experienced a fire blaze that burnt down the school’s administration block, destroying the staff room and typing area. The school then reached out to various government departments and non-governmental organisations to assist in rebuilding the administration block.  Through its corporate social responsibility programme, PGC responded and rebuilt the burnt-down building, which includes a library and computer room.  In-line with its Universal Services and Access Obligation, Vodacom also installed a Cyberlab at the school.  The Deputy Ministers and PGC will thereby officially open the newly-built administration block and Cyberlab. Further, NGO – Kimmotive will hand over 250 packs of sanitary pads and toiletries to learners from indigent households. Members of the media are hereby invited to the outreach programme as follows: Date:  Friday, 20 July 2018 Time: 09h00 – 15h00 Venue: BK Matlala Commercial High School, Matlala-a-Thaba area, Limpopo. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Republic of South Africa: Department of Government Communication and Information.Media filesDownload logo
